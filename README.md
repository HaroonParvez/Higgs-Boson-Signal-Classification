# Higgs Boson Signal Classification

🔍 This academic project used **machine learning techniques** to classify signal events linked to the Higgs Boson from a large dataset of simulated high-energy physics events.

The project focused on identifying meaningful patterns in the dataset to distinguish between background noise and signal events with a high degree of statistical significance.
